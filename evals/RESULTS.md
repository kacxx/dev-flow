Path selection: 12/12 with the plugin. Known gap: on the full case the Idea section sometimes adds small choices of its own; one of the three failing runs was a pure restatement, so the `idea` grader is also stricter than intended.

Not covered by `claude plugin eval` on this machine: steps that need Bash (`gh` search, post, label). The eval sandbox refuses Bash because the local AWS config uses `credential_process`. Duplicate detection was checked with a sub-agent running the skill against kacxx/dev-flow with read-only `gh`: given #1's idea, it found #1 and offered to continue it.
